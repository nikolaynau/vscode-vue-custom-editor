# VS Code Vue Custom Editor

This extension contains an example implementation of a [custom editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors) written in the [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/).
As changes, the editor uses small objects called edit operations.
There is support for multiple views for one document.

This example shows how you can create your own editor in VS Code, and you can also use it as the basis for your own editor, which was done by me in my [ruleengine.org](https://ruleengine.org) project. In my project, I also used a [vue component library](https://ruleenginejs.github.io/ruleengine-ui-demo), created specifically for VS Code.
